    "## Car suspension system\n",
    "Wheels are attached to an automobile through a suspension system that is designed to minimize the vibrations of the passenger compartment that result when traveling over bumpy terrain. The suspension system consists of a spring and shock absorber that are both compressed when the wheel passes over a bump, so that the sudden motion of the wheel is not directly transmitted to the passenger compartment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the mass-spring system mentioned in the lecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](./mass_spring.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The system can be modelled using Hooke's Law as\n",
    "\n",
    "$F=K(x(t)-y(t))=M\\ddot y(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$K$ is the spring constant.\n",
    "$x$ is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The spring generates a force to hold the passenger compartment at a desired distance above the surface of the road, and the shock absorber adds frictional damping. In this problem, you will determine how much damping is desireable by analyzing a simple model of an automobile’s suspension system shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](suspension.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model consists of a mass M that represents the mass of the car, which is connected through a spring and dashpot to the wheel. The vertical displacement of the wheel from it’s equilibrium position is taken as the input x(t). The vertical displacement of the mass from it’s equilibrium position is taken as the output y(t). The spring is assumed to obey Hooke’s law, so that the force it generates is a constant K times the amount that the spring is compressed relative to it’s equilibrium compression. The shock absorber is assumed to generate a force that is a constant B times the velocity with which the shock absorber is compressed. Notice that by referring x(t) and y(t) to their equilibrium positions, the force due to gravity can be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:**: The force generated by the dashpot can be expressed as $B(\\dot x(t)-\\dot y(t))$"

    "### Lab tasks\n",
    "1. Derive the differential equation that relates the input. Assume that M = B = K = 1, modelling and outputing and the transfer function of this system. Check your transfer function with TAs immediately after you derived it.\n",
    "2. Determine and plot the impulse response when $B=0$. Based on this result, give a physical explanation of the problem that would result if there were no shock absorber in the system.\n",
    "3. Determine the threshold value for damping constant $B$, resulting in no oscillation . Plot the impulse response of the system for this value of $B$.\n",
    "4. Consider what if $B$ is very large , derive the transfer function of $B=100$. Plot the impulse response of this system\n",
    "\n",
    "For sign off, the TAs would like to see the outputs: 1. Transfer function both in code and analytical formula; 2. Diagrams for impulse response; 3. Correct value of $B$ and its corresponding impulse response; 4. Diagram for impulse response"
